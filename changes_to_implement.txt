Layer 1: AbuseIPDB (free, 1000/day) - Check on login
Layer 2: IPHub (free, 1000/day) - Proxy/VPN detection
Layer 3: MaxMind GeoLite2 (self-hosted) - ISP/connection type
Fallback: IP2Location Lite (self-hosted)



Scoring System Example

Clean residential IP: Risk score 0-20 (allow)
VPN/Proxy: Risk score 40-60 (challenge with MFA)
Data center IP: Risk score 60-80 (force MFA + manual review)
Known attacker: Risk score 80-100 (block or heavy verification)

Check sequence:
1. Lookup IP → ASN
2. Classify ASN type:
   - Residential ISP (Safaricom, Telkom Kenya) = LOW RISK
   - Mobile carrier = LOW RISK
   - Enterprise/Corporate = MEDIUM RISK (verify)
   - Hosting/Data center (DigitalOcean, AWS) = HIGH RISK
   - Known VPN ASN = HIGH RISK (requires policy decision)

3. Score based on:
   - Is ASN consistent with user's country?
   - Is ASN type unexpected (data center vs residential)?
   - Has user logged from this ASN before?
